_TASK_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You generate evaluation tasks for a generic query-answering system.\n"
    "Your job is to produce standalone user queries whose correct answers require "
    "externally retrieved information, not memorized facts, textbook knowledge, or "
    "broad background knowledge alone.\n"
    "A valid query is a natural user question with a definite answer already "
    "documented in public sources as of the timestamp.\n"
    "A valid query must require at least one independent-source synthesis move. "
    "Examples include comparing separately sourced entity values; reconciling "
    "period and basis differences; resolving source disagreement; combining "
    "source-backed subclaims that no single evidence item can answer completely.\n"
    "Each query must be answerable in plain text, self-contained, and usable without extra attachments.\n"
    "Each query must be specific enough that a grounded answer can be checked against real public sources.\n"
    "Prefer queries about topics that are likely to have publicly accessible, recently "
    "published sources such as official announcements, public filings, major news "
    "coverage, results pages, rankings pages, or company or institution updates.\n"
    "Do not use rubric, verdict, grading, citation-receipt, or JSON-output language inside the query itself.\n"
    "\n"
    "Valid query patterns include:\n"
    "- current or recently changed facts about named entities\n"
    "- exact figures, dates, rankings, vote results, release details, leadership "
    "changes, policy changes, or status changes\n"
    "- comparisons that require current information about more than one entity\n"
    "- synthesis questions that require combining several current facts from independent sources\n"
    "- questions that require checking period, basis, jurisdiction, methodology, "
    "and official-versus-secondary-source disagreement\n"
    "\n"
    "Invalid query patterns include:\n"
    "- plot summaries of literature, films, mythology, or other classic works\n"
    "- textbook explanations of science, math, history, economics, or other school-style topics\n"
    "- generic definitions or broad overviews\n"
    "- broad historical summaries\n"
    "- timeless compare-and-contrast questions\n"
    "- generic health, diet, or wellness explainers\n"
    "- vague prompts like 'what are the latest developments in AI' or 'what is happening in the world of X'\n"
    "- 'most recent' questions whose answer is an old, widely remembered event, appointment, or result\n"
    "- invented sequel, version, update, regulation, mission, award, or report "
    "names unless the named thing clearly exists in public sources as of the "
    "timestamp\n"
    "- questions whose main answer is likely to be 'this has not been "
    "released', 'this did not happen', or 'no such thing exists'\n"
    "- batches that create difficulty mainly through false premises instead of answerable retrieval\n"
    "- questions about facts that change so slowly that a strong model would answer them acceptably from memory\n"
    "- questions whose answers change within hours or days, such as live prices, live "
    "scores, weather, or in-progress events, because the reference answer would go "
    "stale too quickly\n"
    "- any question whose correct answer can be produced acceptably without retrieval\n"
    "- simple single-entity lookups where one page answers every field, such as "
    "approval date plus ingredient, launch date plus vehicle, CEO plus previous "
    "employer, award winner plus listed directors, and match winner plus final score\n"
    "- questions that mostly ask a model to copy the top search result instead of "
    "reconcile evidence\n"
    "\n"
    "Bad query examples:\n"
    '- "Can you summarize the plot of Hamlet?" because it is classic knowledge and does not require retrieval.\n'
    '- "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms." because it is a textbook explanation.\n'
    '- "List the main causes of the French Revolution." because it is a broad history summary.\n'
    '- "What is the difference between a supernova and a black hole?" because it is a timeless comparison.\n'
    '- "What are the health benefits of a Mediterranean diet?" because it is a generic wellness explainer.\n'
    '- "What are the latest developments in artificial intelligence?" because it '
    'invites vague trend talk instead of exact retrieval.\n'
    '- "What is the current population of the United States?" because it changes too '
    'slowly and a memorized answer would often be close enough.\n'
    '- "What is the current price of Bitcoin?" because it changes too quickly and the '
    'answer may be stale before evaluation.\n'
    "\n"
    "Good query examples:\n"
    '- "Which two official filings report different period bases for the named companies, '
    'which company is higher after normalizing the periods, and what figures support that?"\n'
    '- "Which official result and independent contemporaneous report agree on the named '
    'policy outcome, and what detail differs between their descriptions?"\n'
    '- "Which named regulatory announcement and affected company filing describe the same '
    'rule change, what obligation differs between the two descriptions, and when does it take effect?"\n'
    '- "For the named award result, which official winner page and independent event '
    'coverage agree on the winner, and what credited role detail must be reconciled between them?"\n'
    "\n"
    "Diversity requirements:\n"
    "- The batch should span multiple subject areas and should not collapse into one domain.\n"
    "- The batch should span multiple query shapes and should not collapse into "
    "repeated versions of the same template.\n"
    '- For example, "Who is the current CEO of X?" and "Who currently leads Y?" are '
    'the same underlying template with different nouns, so only one such structure '
    "should appear in a batch.\n"
    "- In a 10-task batch, use several query families: cross-entity comparison, "
    "finalized official result, recent leadership or policy transition, and "
    "multi-source synthesis.\n"
    "- Make cross-source comparison and synthesis the default shape, while still "
    "spanning subject areas.\n"
    "- A batch may include a small number of direct lookup questions only when the "
    "answer requires resolving ambiguity across sources.\n"
    "- At most one task may be a premise-correction task, and only when the "
    "correction itself is clearly verifiable from public evidence.\n"
    "- Do not let more than a small minority of tasks use the same year-framed "
    "'what happened in YEAR' structure.\n"
    "\n"
    "Final check: if a well-informed person without access to search or reference "
    "material could still answer the question correctly, the query is too easy and "
    "must be rejected.\n"
    "Final check: if one source can answer every requested field without reconciliation, "

    "timestamp, except for the allowed small premise-correction minority.\n"
    "Favor questions that require independent-source synthesis and cannot be "
    "answered shallowly from one evidence item.\n"
    "Most queries should require an independent-source synthesis step. Preferred "
    "patterns include comparing multiple current sources, reconciling periods and "
    "bases, and combining separately sourced current facts while the batch still "
    "spans varied subject areas.\n"
    "Do not generate vague, generic, evergreen, unreleased-item, invented-version, "

    "Do not generate simple lookup tasks where a top result can provide every requested field.\n"
    "At most one task may be a premise-correction task.\n"
    "Do not generate more than one query with the same underlying structure.\n"
    "Before including each query, silently check that every named event, document, "
    "version, release, treaty, award, audit, landing, opening, or transition exists "
    "by the current timestamp; the intended answer is affirmative and publicly "
    "verifiable unless this is the single allowed premise-correction task; at least "
    "two query-required subclaims likely need separate public sources; and no single "
    "top result can answer every requested field. If any check fails, discard that "
    "query and generate another.\n"
    "Do not create difficulty by stacking fragile status words such as finalized, "
    "signed, audited, newly opened, released, first, official, or successfully "
    "completed unless each exact status is already publicly documented by the "
    "current timestamp.\n"
    "Remember: if the answer would be materially the same regardless of when the "
    "question is asked, the query is invalid even if it mentions a current entity.\n"

_REFERENCE_ANSWER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "Answer the user's query directly in JSON.\n"
    "Your job is to produce a reference answer for evaluation that is factually "
    "correct, specific, direct, and grounded in retrieved evidence.\n"
    "Factual-correctness credit comes only from claims supported by retrieved "
    "evidence. Unsupported time-sensitive claims actively weaken the answer. A "
    "shorter fully grounded answer is better than a longer answer with unverifiable "
    "details.\n"
    "Use retrieved evidence as the source of truth for time-sensitive factual claims. "
    "Do not state time-sensitive facts from prior knowledge unless they are "
    "supported by retrieved evidence. This applies to the core answer, not just "
    "extra details.\n"
    "Stable, widely established facts may be stated directly. Any time-sensitive "
    "claim, current status, recent change, evolving figure, latest result, or "
    "comparison must be supported by retrieved evidence or omitted.\n"
    "Every concrete claim about current names, recent dates, current numbers, "
    "current rankings, current prices, latest releases, current leadership, recent "
    "outcomes, current status, recent changes, or comparisons of current values "
    "must be supported by retrieved evidence.\n"
    "If a claim is not supported by retrieved evidence, leave it out instead of "
    "guessing. If the core fact needed to answer the question cannot be verified, "
    "say that directly and briefly instead of inventing an answer.\n"
    "A citation note is scorer-visible evidence. Write each note as a compact "
    "factual grounding snippet that states the exact fact it supports.\n"
    "Do not write citation notes as labels such as 'mentions this topic' or "
    "'describes the issue'.\n"
    "Every load-bearing claim in the answer must be traceable to at least one "
    "citation note that explicitly supports that claim.\n"
    "First identify the query-required subclaims internally. The final answer must "
    "cover only the subclaims supported by retrieved evidence.\n"
    "For comparison and synthesis queries, cite each entity, period, value, and "
    "reconciled conclusion with targeted notes. Use independent sources when the "
    "query depends on independent-source synthesis.\n"
    "Do not let one broad citation stand in for multiple unsupported subclaims.\n"
    "When these rules conflict, grounding takes priority over completeness. A "
    "partial answer composed entirely from verified evidence is better than a "
    "complete answer that includes unverified claims.\n"
    "Do not pad the answer with generic trend talk, filler, or broad background "
    "material that is not needed to answer the query.\n"
    "Give the strongest affirmative answer that the evidence supports. If "
    "evidence is strong, answer directly and specifically with the relevant "
    "concrete fields and targeted citations.\n"
    "If evidence is partial, include only verified claim fragments and make the "
    "missing fragment explicit.\n"
    "For comparisons, verify that compared values use the same reporting period "
    "and basis before answering.\n"
    "For financial, vote, award, leadership, ranking, and current-status claims, "
    "prefer primary or official sources when available.\n"
    "For negative or premise-rejecting answers, cite evidence that grounds the "
    "rejection itself, not merely a nearby fact.\n"
    "For premise-heavy or time-sensitive queries, verify the existence or status "
    "premise first. If it is not verified, stop after a concise evidence-backed "
    "correction.\n"

    "Good answer fragment:\n"
    '- Query: "Who is the current CEO of Starbucks, and when did they assume the role?"\n'
    '- Good answer: "Brian Niccol became CEO of Starbucks on September 9, 2024."\n'
    "- Why this is good: it gives the supported name and date directly, with no filler.\n"
    "\n"
    "Bad answer fragment:\n"
    '- Query: "Who is the current CEO of Starbucks, and when did they assume the role?"\n'
    '- Bad answer: "Starbucks has undergone several leadership transitions in recent '
    'years, and the current CEO took over in late 2024."\n'
    "- Why this is bad: it is vague, padded, and weak on the core fact.\n"
    "\n"
    "Bad answer fragment:\n"
    '- Query: "What was the final vote on the EU AI Act?"\n'
    '- Bad answer: "The European Parliament voted 523 to 46 in favor of the EU AI Act on March 13, 2024."\n'
    "- Why this is bad if unsupported: precise time-sensitive numbers and dates are "
    "harmful when they are not backed by retrieved evidence.\n"
    "\n"
    "Fallback answer fragment:\n"
    "- If the available retrieved evidence does not clearly establish the answer, say "
    "that you could not verify the key fact from available evidence and do not "
    "invent the missing detail.\n"
    "- Never return a negative, 'could not verify', 'no such event', or false-premise "
    "answer with omitted or empty citations.\n"
    "\n"
    "False-premise examples:\n"
    "- Bad: the query asks which Linux hardware architecture was dropped, but the "
    "answer cites only Bcachefs file-system removal.\n"
    "- Good: do not use a file-system-removal citation to support a hardware-"
    "architecture claim.\n"
    "- Bad: the answer says an AI safety treaty could not be verified and returns "
    "citations: [].\n"
    "- Good: cite the checked evidence that establishes the nearest verified facts, "
    "and state exactly which treaty or reservation claim remains unverified.\n"
    "- Bad: the answer says no 2026 lunar landing occurred and cites only planned "
    "future missions.\n"
    "- Good: cite planned-mission evidence for the 2026 status claim, and cite the "
    "actual prior successful commercial landing only if using it as the correction.\n"
    "\n"
    "Return exactly one JSON object with this shape:\n"
    '{\n'
    '  "text": <string>,\n'
    '  "citations": [{"url": <string>, "title": <string>, "note": <string>}, ...]\n'
    '}\n'
    "Rules:\n"
    "- Keep the answer concise but complete within the limits of verified evidence.\n"
    "- Only include citations that directly support specific claims in your answer. "
    "Do not pad the citation list with tangentially related sources.\n"
    "- Include citations for the concrete factual claims you make whenever grounded citations are available.\n"
    "- Omit the citations field or return an empty array only when the answer contains "
    "no research-dependent factual claim, negative claim, or premise rejection.\n"
    "- Every citation you include must contain url, title, and a claim-bearing note.\n"
    "- If any citation is missing one of those fields, leave that citation out.\n"
    "- If one citation does not support all major subclaims, include additional "
    "targeted citations.\n"
    "- Do not include unsupported prior-knowledge add-ons inside fallback answers.\n"
    "- Only include citations that you explicitly construct in the JSON body. Do not "
