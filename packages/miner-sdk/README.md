# harnyx-miner-sdk

Agent-facing SDK for Harnyx miners: entrypoints, request/response contracts, and tool-call helpers.

This package is imported by **your miner agent script**.

## Entrypoints

Register entrypoints with `@entrypoint(...)`.

Rules:
- Must be `async def`
- Must accept exactly one parameter
- That parameter must be annotated as `harnyx_miner_sdk.query.Query`
- The return type must be `harnyx_miner_sdk.query.Response`

Example:

```python
from harnyx_miner_sdk.decorators import entrypoint
from harnyx_miner_sdk.query import Query, Response


@entrypoint("query")
async def query(query: Query) -> Response:
    return Response(text=query.text)
```

## Query contract

Validators call `query` with a `Query` payload:

```json
{
  "text": "Explain why validator sandboxes matter."
}
```

Your return value must validate as:

```json
{
  "text": "Sandboxes isolate miner code so validators can run untrusted scripts safely."
}
```

or, when your answer needs receipt-backed support:

```json
{
  "text": "Sandboxes isolate miner code so validators can run untrusted scripts safely.",
  "citations": [
    {"receipt_id": "receipt-123", "result_id": "result-abc"}
  ]
}
```

Both `Query` and `Response` are strict Pydantic models:
- extra fields are rejected
- `text` is required
- empty/whitespace-only strings are rejected
- `citations` is optional
- `text` may contain at most 80,000 characters
- `citations`, when present, may contain at most 200 receipt refs
- each citation must include `receipt_id` and `result_id`
- citation refs may also include `slices=[CitationSlice(start=..., end=...)]`; refs without slices use the entire referenced result text
- citations may materialize at most 400 evidence segments and 120,000 source-text characters per answer

For practical scoring, treat `citations` as required for answers that make non-obvious factual claims or depend on search/tool evidence. A response without citations only makes sense when the answer is obvious enough that no external support is reasonably needed. Facts presented without citations can be dismissed by the judge when they are load-bearing to the answer.

When citations are present, validators hydrate them into shared citations shaped like
`{url, title?, note?}` before scoring. Hydrated citation notes are materialized by the validator from the referenced tool result's `note` text. A ref without slices materializes the full result note. A ref with slices materializes only those offsets. Miner-authored citation text is not accepted as evidence.

## Receipts and citations

Hosted tool calls return two layers of identifiers:

- `receipt_id`: the tool call itself
- `result_id`: a specific referenceable result from that tool call

Your `Response.citations` must point at the exact result(s) that support your answer:

```python
from harnyx_miner_sdk.api import search_web
from harnyx_miner_sdk.query import CitationRef, Query, Response


async def query(query: Query) -> Response:
    search = await search_web(query.text, num=5)
    top_result = search.results[0]
    return Response(
        text="...",
        citations=[
            CitationRef(
                receipt_id=search.receipt_id,
                result_id=top_result.result_id,
            )
        ],
    )
```

How to extract them:

- call a hosted tool such as `search_web(...)`
- read the tool-call envelope `search.receipt_id`
- choose the specific supporting result from `search.results`
- read that result's `result_id`
- return `CitationRef(receipt_id=..., result_id=...)` for whole-result evidence
- return `CitationRef(receipt_id=..., result_id=..., slices=[CitationSlice(start=0, end=180)])` when a narrower excerpt is enough

Targeted slice example:

```python
from harnyx_miner_sdk.query import CitationRef, CitationSlice

CitationRef(
    receipt_id=search.receipt_id,
    result_id=top_result.result_id,
    slices=[CitationSlice(start=0, end=180)],
)
```

The relevant SDK fields are:

```python
search.receipt_id
search.results[i].result_id
search.results[i].url
search.results[i].title
search.results[i].note
```

Use the citation only when that result actually supports a material claim in your response. Prefer results whose `note` text already contains the factoid or excerpt your answer depends on. Whole-result citations are valid; targeted slices are useful when a large result contains both relevant and irrelevant text. Irrelevant citations do not help, and citation spam makes the response worse.

## Tool helpers

These helpers call validator-hosted tools when running inside the sandbox:
- `search_web(query, timeout=..., **kwargs)`
- `search_ai(query, timeout=..., **kwargs)`
- `fetch_page(url, timeout=...)`
- `llm_chat(messages=[...], model="...", timeout=..., temperature=0.0, thinking={"enabled": True})`
- `tooling_info(timeout=...)`
- `test_tool(message, timeout=...)`

Every hosted tool helper accepts an optional positive finite `timeout` in seconds. For provider-backed tools, the tool host bounds the complete provider-backed invocation, including retries/backoff, and raises a tool invocation error if the deadline expires. `tooling_info` and `test_tool` accept the same parameter for interface consistency, but they complete locally and do not perform provider deadline enforcement.

`llm_chat` accepts a typed `thinking` option:

| Model | `enabled=True` / `enabled=False` | `effort` | `budget` |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------|----------|
| `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1-TEE` | Supported via `chat_template_kwargs.thinking` | No verified knob; ignored | No verified knob; ignored |
| `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-TEE` | Supported via `chat_template_kwargs.thinking` | No verified knob; ignored | No verified knob; ignored |
| `zai-org/GLM-5-TEE` | Supported via `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` | No verified knob; ignored | No verified knob; ignored |
| `Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct` | No verified request-side control; accepted but serializes no thinking field | Ignored | Ignored |
| `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-TEE` | Supported via `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` when routed through the custom OpenAI-compatible Qwen endpoint | No verified knob; ignored | No verified knob; ignored |
| `google/gemma-4-31B-turbo-TEE` | Supported via `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` when routed through the custom OpenAI-compatible Gemma endpoint | No verified knob; ignored | No verified knob; ignored |

```python
await llm_chat(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-TEE",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Solve 17 * 23."}],
    temperature=0.0,
    thinking={"enabled": True},
)

await llm_chat(
    model="zai-org/GLM-5-TEE",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with only ok."}],
    temperature=0.0,
    thinking={"enabled": False},
)
```

Omit `thinking` to use provider defaults. `effort` accepts `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"` and `budget` must be a positive integer, but no current miner `llm_chat` model has a verified effort or budget provider knob. Do not send `effort` and `budget` together; that is a validation error. Provider support is best effort, so unsupported level/budget hints are ignored instead of becoming raw provider-body fields.
