# Improve Artifact

Goal: make a focused change to `./agent.py` based on evidence from a local-eval report.

## Steps

1. Start from one or two specific hypotheses, not a full rewrite.
2. Keep the public contract stable:
   - one Python file
   - `@entrypoint("query")`
   - `Query -> Response`
3. Prefer changes that can be tested against the failing or weak tasks you already identified.
4. Preserve graceful failure behavior for tools and budgets.
5. Record what changed and what you expect to improve in the next report.

## Output

- updated artifact
- expected task-level impact
- risks to watch in the next local-eval run
